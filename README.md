# SQL

Welcome to my SQL Projects repository! This repository showcases three separate projects that I have developed to enhance my SQL skills.

## Covid Portfolio Project

In this project, I dive into the world of COVID-19 data analysis using SQL. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and testing information, I showcase my skills in querying, aggregating, and analyzing the data to uncover valuable insights. 

## Nashville Data Cleaning Project

With this project, I demonstrate my expertise in data cleaning and preparation using SQL queries. I employ various SQL techniques to transform the data into a clean, consistent, and reliable format.

## Starbucks Food Project

I analyzed the menu of a Starbucks location by looking at the nutritional facts of each item in the data set.
